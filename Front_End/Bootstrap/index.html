              I just wanna use the phone. Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up. Indeed I will, roll em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet one trip I must be out of my mind. What is it Einy? Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you. Look, George, I'm telling you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.

              Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Uh, no, no, no, no. What are you looking at, butt-head? Thanks a lot, kid. Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.

              Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out? Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright? It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. Who's are these? I don't wanna see you in here again.
